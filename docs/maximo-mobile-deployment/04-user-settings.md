# Personalizing Your Maximo Mobile Experience

## Changing Default Insert Site

You can change your default insert site directly within the Maximo Mobile application to ensure accuracy for new records you create.

## Changing Time Zone

While each Maximo Mobile user is assigned a default time zone from the server, users can set the time zone from their mobile device if they cross multiple time zones.

* **Administrator Action:** A system administrator must first enable this option by selecting the **Show time zone settings** option for the `Display time zone menu` property in the Mobile Administration application.
* **User Action:** Once enabled, the user can open the **Settings** menu on the device, select **Time zone**, and choose the option to match the device's current time zone. The app will reload to reflect the update.

## Language Support

Maximo Mobile supports multiple languages, allowing users to work in their preferred language setting.
