# MAS 9 Deployment and Application Setup

This guide provides the necessary information for a support analyst to assist field technicians with the Maximo Mobile installation and initial connection.

## Mobile Client Application Requirements

[cite_start]Before installation, verify the technician's device meets the minimum specifications[cite: 9]:

| Requirement Area | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operating System** | [cite_start]Check the IBM documentation for supported versions of iOS and Android[cite: 9]. |
| **Minimum Memory** | [cite_start]Minimum RAM required to ensure smooth operation, especially when handling large amounts of data offline[cite: 9]. |
| **Free Storage** | [cite_start]Sufficient free storage is crucial for the application itself and for storing the synced work data[cite: 9]. |
| **Biometric Support** | [cite_start]Device must support Face ID or Fingerprint recognition if those login methods are enabled[cite: 9]. |

## Maximo Mobile App Installation

[cite_start]The official IBM Maximo Mobile application (white icon) is available on the main app stores[cite: 6]:

* **iOS Devices:** Apple App Store
* **Android Devices:** Google Play Store
* **Windows Devices:** Microsoft Store

**Support Tip:** Always verify the technician is installing the correct version designated for your MAS instance.

## Initial Connection - The Critical Step

[cite_start]To connect the app to the corporate Maximo server, the technician must enter the correct **MAS Server URL**[cite: 1, 6].

1.  **Obtain the URL:** The required URL is the one displayed in the browser when an authorized user is logged into the Maximo Application Suite. [cite_start]This is sometimes referred to as the **Maximo Manage server address**[cite: 1, 6].
2.  [cite_start]**Input:** The technician enters this URL into the mobile application when prompted during the initial setup[cite: 1, 6].

**Analyst Action:** Ensure this specific URL is documented and easily accessible to all field users. An incorrect URL is the most common connection error.
