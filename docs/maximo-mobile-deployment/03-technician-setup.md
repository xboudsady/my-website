# Getting Started for Maximo Mobile Users

This section covers the immediate actions a technician takes after the app is installed and connected to the server.

## Default Insert Site Management

[cite_start]The **Default Insert Site** determines which site (location) new records (like meter readings or service requests) are created under when the technician is using the app[cite: 8].

* [cite_start]**Importance:** Using the correct site is vital for accurate asset tracking and work management[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**User Action:** The technician can easily change their default insert site directly within the Maximo Mobile application settings if they move between different geographical sites[cite: 8].

## Time Zone Configuration

[cite_start]Maximo Mobile allows the technician's device to dictate the time zone for all timestamped entries (e.g., when a work order is started or completed)[cite: 5].

* [cite_start]**Server Default:** The server sets a default time zone, but this can be overridden[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**User Action:** To match the device's current time zone, the technician can go to the **Settings** menu on the mobile device and select **Time zone** to choose the option to match the device's current setting[cite: 5]. [cite_start]This is helpful for technicians who travel across different time zones[cite: 5].

## Language Support

[cite_start]Maximo Mobile is configured to support multiple languages to ensure clarity for your global field workforce[cite: 2].

* [cite_start]The application will generally follow the language setting of the mobile device's operating system[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**Analyst Note:** Ensure that the required language packs are installed and enabled on the Maximo server side for the language to display correctly in the mobile client[cite: 2].
